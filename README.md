### Step 1: the simplest thing

Create a simple String calculator with a method int add(String numbers).

- The string argument can contain 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example "" or "1" or "1,2".
- Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers.
- Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about.
- Remember to refactor after each passing test.

### Step 2: handle an unknown amount of numbers

Allow the add() method to handle an unknown amount of numbers.
